# hello-world
My first repository, greeting the world. Everyone is welcome to pitch me with ideas 
and fun/curious facts about anything!

Hi reader!

I am Ignacio. As of this moment I am a student studying computer science. I thoroughly 
enjoy the idea of open-source projects and of the neat organization features that
GitHub provides. I am a really curious person, desiring to learn about everything.
I am, however, specially interested in rock climbing, adventure sports, food,
travelling, AI and Machine Learning.
